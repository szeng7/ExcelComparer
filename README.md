This is a tool written in VB script that allows the user to compare two excel files to determine the differences between the two. Due to it being intended to compare files that were used to create web pages, the tool can detect inserted rows but not inserted columns. 

Potential Future Fixes:

Consider adding way to have leeway when comparing rows (instead of checking that every column in a row is the same to infer that there's an insert, maybe check only the first column). 

Consider adding ability for tool to detect inserted columns in sheets.
